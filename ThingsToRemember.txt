Things to remember

1. Polynomial rolling hash function.

String hashing : https://cp-algorithms.com/string/string-hashing.html

hash(s) = (s[0] + s[1]*p + s[2]*p^2 + ... + s[n-1] * p^n-1) mod m

Choice of p = (Prime number which is greater than the size of input alphabet)
Choice of m = Large prime number (10^9 + 9)


2. String `split` function
